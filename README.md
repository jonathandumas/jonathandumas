- 👋 Hi, I’m @jonathandumas a Teaching assistant at Liège University.
- 👀 I’m interested in helping the energy transition towards a carbon-free economy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many research topics such as:
  * probabilistic forecasting and machine learning applied to power systems
  * decision-making under uncertainty: stochastic and robust optimization 
  * energy management system
  * computing and planning long term energy system scenarios to help the energy transition
- 💞️ I’m also looking to collaborate on the energy transition towards a carbon-free economy:
  * designing new lectures and lessons to educate people and students on these transversal topics
  * understand how to make things change by taking into account the human psychology 
  * making climate and digital collages
  * any projects that can help to make tiny changes :)
